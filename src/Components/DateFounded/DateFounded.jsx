        <h4>Approach</h4>
        <p>Born from one family’s passion for Kenya and its wilderness, the Wildlife Rescue Hub  is one 
          of the pioneering conservation organisations
           for wildlife and habitat protection in Kenya.We are best known for our work with elephants, operating the most successful orphan elephant rescue and rehabilitation program in the world. While the Orphans’ Project is the heart of the organisation, it cannot exist in isolation and over the last O month the Wildlife Resque Hub has developed an extensive, multi-faceted approach to conservation to ensure a greater and long-lasting impact for wildlife.

Through our Aerial, Anti-Poaching and Mobile Veterinary Units, we are actively safeguarding the natural environment and providing immediate assistance to wild animals in need. Our renowned Orphans’ Project allows us to respond to and rescue orphaned baby elephants, rhinos and other wild species across Kenya, so that they might enjoy a life back in the wild when grown.</p>
